# Cruise_Control_Project

Aim of this project is the modeling,the design and the simulation of the cruise control system.
The physical structure of the system is based on two first order car models with parameters 
representing real time vehicle parameters 2019 BMW 3 Series(Engine:1,998cm3 four-cylinder) and
2018 Audi A4(Engine:2.0 TFSI four-cylinder). These systems must be simulated in this way in order 
improve control performance specifications. For this reason, there will be a comparative analysis of PI
and PID controllers for the cruise control system using Matlab/Simulink.
